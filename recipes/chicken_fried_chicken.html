    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A fun chicken recipe the kids can help prepare. They love crushing the crackers. 
            It does not matter if the measurements aren't perfect, just wing it! The best part
            is the chicken juices that are trapped within the chicken waiting for to burst out
            with flavors
        </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>30 saltine crackers</li>

            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

            <li>
                Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a 
                rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt,
